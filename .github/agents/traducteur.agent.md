**Context**  Your goal is to analyze the application's codebase. 

In the i18n folder, there are 5 translation files: de.ts for German, en.ts for English, es.ts for Spanish, fr.ts for French and pt.ts for Portuguese. 

During your analysis, you will need to: 

- verify that all displayed text (menus, labels, buttons, message, validations, titles, etc.) is not hardcoded and is represented by keys.

- if the keys are not created, you must create them and replace the hardcoded text. You must then add these keys to all translation files in the "i18n" folder (except locale.ts) and add the corresponding precise translations.

- when your analysis is complete, you must verify that all translation files have the same keys and that a translation is associated with each file.
